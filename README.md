## Projects
### Excel Projects
#### 1. Bike Sales Project 
This a Customer Behaviour Analysis to understand the reasons for bike purchase. 
Raw data was cleaned, transformed and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. Slicers were introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to customers’ region and marital status possible.
Primary KPIs included; Average Income Per Customer, Purchase per Age Bracket & Customer Commute i.e. Distance from house to workplace. 
It was found that, the shop’s clientele primarily consists of middle-aged individuals and bike sales declined as commute distance of customers increased. 
Stakeholder was therefore advised to target mainly on the middle-aged customers and customers with shorter commute distances. But a further sales investigation is highly recommended.
Raw Data Source: Alex The Analyst.

#### 2. Call Center Project
A customer satisfaction analysis for a call center in USA.
The data was transformed & loaded with Power Query into Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. A slicer was introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to call channels possible.		
Primary KPIs included: Total Inbound Calls, Total Call Duration in Hours, Average Handle Time in Minutes & Average Satisfaction Score.
Secondary KPIs were; Percentage of Calls Per SLA, Sentiments Per Center, Reasons Per Call & Sentiments Per Call.
It was found that, even though, majority of the calls were within the SLA (Service Level Agreement), a large amount is not. Baltimore & Los Angeles had the greatest number of Sentiments.
It is recommended that training sessions should be organised for staff in relation to handling billing-related queries. This will help improve the Customer Satisfaction score.		
Further call data investigation is advised.

#### 3. Road Accident Project
This Car Accident Analysis is to understand the factors responsible and situations involved in accidents in UK.  
Raw data was cleaned, transformed and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. 
Slicers were introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to Year and Rural/Urban possible.
The Primary KPIs: Total Casualties, The Percentage of Severity of Casualties, Vehicle Type with the Most Casualties. 
The Secondary KPIs: Total Casualties with Each Vehicle Type, Monthly Trend in 2021 VS 2022, Total Casualties by Road Type, Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.	
The data suggests a decrease in casualties from 2021 to 2022, but monthly variations need attention. Cars were the major contributors to casualties, and efforts should focus on improving safety in urban areas and on single carriageways.
Raw Data Source: Kaggle.

### SQL Projects
#### 1. COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This project is for analyzing and understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. By combining COVID-19 death data with vaccination data (these excel files are located in repository). The project also looks at how well the COVID-19 vaccination is going, giving us a complete picture of how the pandemic is unfolding.
Utilizing CTE and Partition by, it calculates cumulative vaccinated individuals, and a Tableau-ready view is created.
Primary KPIs: Total COVID-19 Cases & Deaths, Death Percentage Per Total Cases, Percentage of Population Infected, Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population, Global total cases, total deaths & death percentage.
Secondary KPIs: Countries with Highest Death Count per Population, Continents with Highest Death Counts, Percentage of Population Vaccinated, Rolling (Cumulative) People Vaccinated.

### Power BI Projects
#### 1. Minnesota Interstate Traffic Volume Visualization
This is a Minnesota Interstate Highways Traffic Volume analysis. The cleaned and transformed excel data was loaded into Power BI and analysed with distinct charts based on the traffic volume’s relation to Weather, Holiday & Year. 
Cloudy and Clear conditions collectively contributed massively to the Traffic Volume per Weather conditions with the former being the major contributor. Rain has a fairly large amount of total traffic volume. 
The Sum of Traffic Volume in the year 2017 was the greatest, with 2012 being the year with the least traffic volume in the interstate.
Per holidays, New Year’s Day had the most traffic volume but holidays had no significant impact on the traffic volume.
Recommendations: Reduction of driving or riding in precipitation & low-visibility weather conditions, should be monitored & prevented.
Further analysis should be done later with the hourly, daily and monthly traffic volume relations in consideration.

### 2. Bank Target Marketing Visualization
Per insights from visualization, majority of Clients fall in the Management & Blue-Collar jobs. The job distribution suggests a diverse clientele. The majority of clients fall into the middle-aged category (37,823).
Married clients have the highest average balance ($1,458.85), and this indicates that marital status of clients may have an influence on their financial standing.
Out of all clients, 10,578 (18.76%) have made a deposit while 45,795 (81.24%) have not. The data suggests a substantial portion of clients have not made a deposit, potentially indicating an opportunity for targeted marketing or incentive campaigns to encourage deposits.
Further analysis and segmentation could unveil deeper patterns and opportunities for the bank to enhance its services and customer satisfaction.

### R Projects
#### 1. E-Commerce Webpage A/B Testing 
This project compares the conversion rates of two groups (control and treatment) using A/B testing in R.
The data was imported from "ab_data.csv".
Analysis Steps are; Data Exploration, Calculate Conversion Rates, Visualize Conversion Rates & Chi-square Test
Results from the analysis are as follows; Conversion rate for control group: 12.0%, Conversion rate for treatment group: 11.9%, Chi-square test result: X-squared = 1.5193, p-value = 0.2177.
With this, the X-squared value (1.5193) was not extremely high or low therefore there was no significant difference in both groups and the p-value (0.2177) which is >0.05 indicates that there's no significance in the conversion rates of the treatment and control groups.
