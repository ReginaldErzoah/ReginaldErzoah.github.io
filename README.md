# Projects
Projects are grouped based on data or related fields.

## Data Analytics & BI Projects.
### 1. OPEX Vs Budget Performance Analytics
This is a BI report to track and compare actual expenditure (OPEX) each month vs what was budgeted across certain business categories.
This helps monitor spending and detect overspending or underspending.

Tools used were Google Sheets, Power BI & Figma.

The report is broken down into 2 pages which all track few but essential metrics on an executive summary and category performance level.

Project files are available in the GitHub project folder [Here](https://github.com/ReginaldErzoah/Data-Analytics-BI-Projects/tree/main/OPEX%20Vs%20Budget%20Performance%20Analytics)

### 2. Personal Fitness Analytics
This is a Personal Fitness Analytics built with the data from my Google Fit through Google Takeout.

Tools used were Excel, Power BI & Figma.

So what makes this project different from the others?
Aside it being personal, it is also different because of the use of more dynamic narratives for a better user experience.

The report is broken down into 3 pages which all track few but essential metrics on an overview, month year and year-to-date level.

### 3. Supply Chain Performance Analytics

**Objective:**
Evaluate the performance of a supply chain company.
To better identify the areas that needs attention and improvement.

**Data Source:**
DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset from Kaggle.

**User Experience:**
The entire user-centric BI report was built in Power BI, with the background designed in Figma.

**Key Insights:** Total profit amounted to $4m with total orders of 64k, On-time deliveries percentage was 17.84%, Late delivery was the most occurring delivery status and Repeat customer percentage was 60.12%


**Next Steps:** Work on connecting the BI to a database for real-time analysis and Consider forecasting visuals for better decision making.

### 4. Smart Energy Analytics
This project analyzes energy consumption trends across industries, homes, and public sectors while also predicting total energy consumption for the region.

**Objective:** Understand the impact of grid import and solar generation on total energy consumption.

**Data Source:** Open Power System Data, KN, Germany (2015-2019).

**User Experience:** Interactive features such as navigation, a dynamic filter pane, and color-coded KPI indicators enhance user experience.
An additional feature used was Power BI's built-in forecasting, which predicts total energy consumption based on available data.

**Key Insights:** Grid import accounted for 88.81% of total energy consumption, Solar generation led to a 433.19M kg COâ‚‚ reduction over the study period, Solar generation declined significantly in 2019 and 2024 energy consumption forecast: ~867.75M kWh.

**Challenges:** Data was limited to 2019, restricting long-term analysis.

**Next Steps:** Investigate cause of low solar power generation in 2019, validate forecasts with actual 2024 data and analyze energy use by household equipment.

## UI/UX Design Projects.
### 1. Smart Energy Analytics - Mobile Optimization.
The Smart Energy Analytics BI Dashboard was redesigned to provide stakeholders with seamless access to key data insights on their mobile devices using Figma.

**Objective:** To adapt a desktop-oriented dashboard into a mobile-friendly experience without sacrificing functionality, clarity, or usability.

**Key Challenges & Design Solutions:** Optimized layout for smaller screens, ensuring readability, touch-friendly gestures, simplified navigation, and fast performance for smooth mobile interactions.

**Results:** The desktop dashboard was successfully adapted to a mobile-friendly version, whiles still displaying relevant visuals.

**Next steps:** Adopting this design to other mobile platforms for broader accessibility.
