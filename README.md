## Projects
### Excel Projects
#### 1. Bike Sales Project 
This a Customer Behaviour Analysis to understand the reasons for bike purchase. 
Raw data was cleaned, transformed and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. Slicers were introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to customers’ region and marital status possible.
Primary KPIs included; Average Income Per Customer, Purchase per Age Bracket & Customer Commute i.e. Distance from house to workplace. 
It was found that, the shop’s clientele primarily consists of middle-aged individuals and bike sales declined as commute distance of customers increased. 
Stakeholder was therefore advised to target mainly on the middle-aged customers and customers with shorter commute distances. But a further sales investigation is highly recommended.
Raw Data Source: Alex The Analyst.

#### 2. Call Center Project
A customer satisfaction analysis for a call center in USA.
The data was transformed & loaded with Power Query into Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. A slicer was introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to call channels possible.		
Primary KPIs included: Total Inbound Calls, Total Call Duration in Hours, Average Handle Time in Minutes & Average Satisfaction Score.
Secondary KPIs were; Percentage of Calls Per SLA, Sentiments Per Center, Reasons Per Call & Sentiments Per Call.
It was found that, even though, majority of the calls were within the SLA (Service Level Agreement), a large amount is not. Baltimore & Los Angeles had the greatest number of Sentiments.
It is recommended that training sessions should be organised for staff in relation to handling billing-related queries. This will help improve the Customer Satisfaction score.		
Further call data investigation is advised.

#### 3. Road Accident Project: 
This Car Accident Analysis is to understand the factors responsible and situations involved in accidents in UK.  
Raw data was cleaned, transformed and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Charts visualized on dashboard (in project file) were all created with Pivot tables. 
Slicers were introduced in the visualization to make filtering data according to Year and Rural/Urban possible.
The Primary KPIs: Total Casualties, The Percentage of Severity of Casualties, Vehicle Type with the Most Casualties. 
The Secondary KPIs: Total Casualties with Each Vehicle Type, Monthly Trend in 2021 VS 2022, Total Casualties by Road Type, Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.	
The data suggests a decrease in casualties from 2021 to 2022, but monthly variations need attention. Cars were the major contributors to casualties, and efforts should focus on improving safety in urban areas and on single carriageways.
Raw Data Source: Kaggle.
