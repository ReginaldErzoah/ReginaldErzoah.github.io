## Data & BI Projects.
### 1. Smart Energy Analytics
This project analyzes energy consumption trends across industries, homes, and public sectors while also predicting total energy consumption for the region.

Objective: Understand the impact of grid import and solar generation on total energy consumption.

Data Source: Open Power System Data, KN, Germany (2015-2019).
Over 1.1 million records of energy consumption in industries, public areas and residences.

Interactive features such as navigation, a dynamic filter pane, and color-coded KPI indicators enhance user experience.
An additional feature used was Power BI's built-in forecasting, which predicts total energy consumption based on available data.

Key Insights include; Grid import accounted for 88.81% of total energy consumption, Solar generation led to a 433.19M kg COâ‚‚ reduction over the study period, Solar generation declined significantly in 2019 and 2024 energy consumption forecast: ~867.75M kWh.

Challenges: Data was limited to 2019, restricting long-term analysis.

Next Steps: Investigate cause of low solar power generation in 2019, validate forecasts with actual 2024 data and analyze energy use by household equipment.
